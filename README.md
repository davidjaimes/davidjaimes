Iâ€™m a grant analyst for the [City of San Diego](https://www.sandiego.gov). Previously, I was an astronomer studying stellar eclipsing binaries, gyrochronology of sun-like stars, and supernovae spectra. I enjoy trail running, bicycling, fine dinning, web design, programming, writing software, and reading in my free time.
